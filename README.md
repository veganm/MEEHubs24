# MEEHubs24
Code repository for R workshops at MEEHubs24 ATL

*Hello there! Welcome to the world of POKEMON! People call me the POKEMON THEORIST!*

*The world is inhabited by creatures called POKEMON! For some people, POKEMON are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself... I study the ecology and evolution of POKEMON as a profession.*

*Welcome to the lab, new student! I have a big data set from our experimental collaborator that needs to be analyzed. Can you take care of that? I'm very busy right now, but I'm sure one of the senior students will be able to help you get started.*

*Well, I have to run to a meeting. Good luck!*

In these workshops, participants will take on the role of a Pokemon researcher as we learn to interrogate data sets in R. By the end of the series, participants will be able to manipulate and reshape data objects, explore data visualizations using an arsenal of tools from packages on CRAN and GitHub, and create pubication-quality plots to answer data-based research questions in R. As a bonus, we will learn a few new things about the ecology and evolution of Pokemon along the way.
