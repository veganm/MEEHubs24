This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Getting Started
At this point, you should:
* Have R and RStudio installed (this code was written in R version 4.3.1)
* Have set up a home directory for R
* Know what CRAN is
* Know what a "package" is in R and why we need to use them

First, let's install and load in the packages we will need to use. We'll do most of our work today in base R, but we'll use a little bit of functionality from Tidyverse. The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for use in data science, all of which work nicely together due to an underlying shared grammar and data structures.

First, install the tidyverse:
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

To use an installed library in R, you first have to load it into your workspace. The function that does this is called *library()*. It is best to do this at the start of a script or workflow.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Also, we need to get some data to work with. The dataset we will be working with today is a data frame of Pokemon data, available as package *pokemon* on CRAN.
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
# we are asking the code chunk to be quiet
install.packages("pokemon")
library(pokemon)
```

*******************************************************************************************************************************************
*******************************************************************************************************************************************
# Data Objects and Types in R
Almost everything in R is some kind of *object*. A data object has a unique name (R is case sensitive - A1 and a1 are different objects) and contains a value or a set of values.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************
## Objects
Objects in R are assigned a value using "<-". Consider the example below:
```{r}
a1<-10
A1<-5
```

Look at the Environment tab (it's over there ->). What do you see?
What happens when you run the code below?
```{r}
a1<-1
A1<-0.5
```

R won't give you a warning when you over-write an object that already exists, so be careful!

Note that when we carry out an operation using an object, the original object is not changed merely by the use of the operation:
```{r}
a1
a1+1
a1
```

But we can re-assign (over-write) an object whenever we feel like it:
```{r}
a1 <- a1+1
a1
```


**EXERCISE: You try it!** In the empty code block below, create a named object and give it a value. When you are naming objects, remember that:
* Object names are case sensitive (a1 and A1 are different objects)
* Names can contain numbers and letters but CANNOT start with a number
* You can use underscores (_), but other special characters (. / + $ etc) should be avoided
* Avoid using function names as object names (we'll talk about functions later)
```{r}

```



*******************************************************************************************************************************************
## Calculations
R can do any basic calculation:
```{r}
2+2
2*2
2/2
2-2
```

If you have data objects in your workspace, R can also carry out operations on those objects:
```{r}
a1+A1
a1*A1
a1/A1
a1-A1
```

**EXERCISE: You try it!** In the empty code block below, carry out some simple operations using the object you named. Try using your object in combination with numeric values and with the other named objects in your environment.
```{r}

```




*******************************************************************************************************************************************
## Vectors
An object can contain more than one value. For example, you can *concatenate* numbers together using the *c()* function, creating a data vector:
```{r}
a2<-c(5, 10, 15, 20)
```

We can check that this object is, in fact, a vector:
```{r}
is.vector(a2)
```

What about the objects we assigned earlier, which contain a single numeric value?
```{r}
is.vector(a1)
```

As far as R is concerned, this is a vector object with a length of 1.
```{r}
length(a1)
length(a2)
```

Values within a vector can be referred to by their *index* - the position that they occupy in the vector. When we put a (integer!) number in brackets [] next to a named object, that will retrieve the value stored in the object at the index in the brackets.
```{r}
a2[1]
```

Note that the first position in a R vector has index position 1, unlike some other languages that start indexing at 0:
```{r}
a2[0]
```

Vectors can contain any kind of data. The example above was a vector of numbers, but a vector can contain strings:
```{r}
a3<-c("one", "two", "three")
```
 
 or logicals:
```{r}
a4<-c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
```
 
Look in the environment. Can you confirm the data type and contents for each of these vectors?

Vectors can be used in operations as well. By default, R carries out *element-wise* operations.
```{r}
a2
a2+1
```

What happened?

**EXERCISE: You try it!** In the empty code block below, create an operation that will multiply each element of the vector *a2* by 10.
```{r}

```

What happens when you multiply the vector *a2* by itself? Create and run this operation.
```{r}

```

*******************************************************************************************************************************************
# Functions in R
Most things that we will do in R will involve calls to functions. A function is a piece of code that runs only when it is called and that performs a task when you call it. Many functions take inputs (external data or user-defined parameters) and return an object. Function calls look like this:

> FunctionName(input1, input2, input3) # as many inputs as this function needs

The libraries you install from CRAN have their own functions, which you can call once the library is installed and loaded into your workspace.

To give you the idea of how this works, here's a very simple function that takes no inputs:
```{r}
my_function <- function(){ #Create a function with the name my_function
  print("Hello World!") # the code to be executed is within the brackets
}
```

Once the function exists, it can be called:
```{r}
my_function()
```

How about a function that takes an input?
```{r}
addto3<-function(addend){
  new_value<-addend+3 # The operation to be performed
  return(new_value)  # the object to be returned when the function is called
  }
```

When we call this function, we must provide a numeric value for "addend":
```{r}
addto3(4.5)
```

We can save the returned value as a new object:
```{r}
a5<-addto3(4.5)
a5
```

R is smart enough to return an error if you try to pass a non-numeric value to a function that does a numeric operation:
```{r}
addto3("apple")
```

But there are plenty of operations that can be done on character strings. One common operation is *concatenation*, which is carried out here by the *paste()* function:
```{r}
underscore_it<-function(text1, text2){
  new_value<-paste(text1, "_", text2, sep="") # The operation to be performed
  return(new_value)  # the object to be returned when the function is called
  } # note that new_value only exists inside the function - check your environment, it isn't there!
```

This function uses a text-based operation and can therefore accept strings:
```{r}
underscore_it("apple", "banana")
```
Fun fact - since this function knows that the inputs are supposed to be characters, if you pass it numeric values, it'll convert numbers into text and concatenate them anyway:
```{r}
underscore_it(2, 8)
```


**EXAMPLE: You try it!** What do you think will happen if you pass a numeric vector to *addto3()*? In the empty code block below, create a new numeric vector as a named object. Pass this vector to the *addto3()* function, saving the output as a new object. Did this work as you expected?
```{r}

```


In the empty code block below, create a function that carries out some other simple one-step operation.
```{r}

```

Call your new function and confirm that it works as expected.
```{r}

```



*******************************************************************************************************************************************
*******************************************************************************************************************************************
# Data Frames and Tibbles
Many of the data sets we work with can be described as (or made to be) a kind of table, where each row represents a different entity and each column represents a different aspect of that entity. Let's take a simple example. Here we are going to build our own data set by entering the data manually as a series of vectors.

In R, we will build this data object as a *tibble*. You can think of a tibble as a kind of lazy data frame; when you make a tibble, it doesn't try to do much to make your data make sense, or to repair your data names. This is a good thing; you get to make more decisions about the contents of your own data. It does mean you have to be a bit careful about how you build.

We can make a tibble out of almost anything. If we're lazy and don't name arguments, they get named with the expression used:
```{r}
tibble(a2, a2+10)
```

If one of your inputs is a vector of length 1, it will be recycled as many times as needed to match the length of the tibble:
```{r}
tibble(a2, a1)
```

But tibbles are lazy - a vector of length 2 won't be recycled, even if it could be.
```{r}
a22<-c(2,2)
tibble(a2, a22)
```


Tibbles can contain different data types, as long as the number of rows is compatible. Each named column will have its own type.
```{r}
mydata<-tibble(animal=c("dog", "cat", "mouse", "horse"),
               kg=c(30, 4.5, 0.025, 550),
               body_len=c(75, 46, 10, 2400)
)
mydata
```

This object has a shape and size:
```{r}
dim(mydata) # rows, then columns
```
and names:
```{r}
names(mydata)
```

*******************************************************************************************************************************************
## Intro to data manipulation in Tidyverse
Tidyverse makes it very easy to manipulate data in the form of tibbles. (**For each of the following:** How big do you expect the resulting tibble to be? How many rows and columns?)

First, we can mutate (transform) existing columns and append the results to the tibble. 
```{r}
mydata<-mydata %>%
  mutate(lbs=2.2046*kg)
mydata
```


*******************************************************************************************************************************************
Wait - what did we do there? That's called a **pipe**, and it comes from a Tidyverse package called **magrittr**. The pipe is a great way to keep your R code clean, readable, and therefore maintanable. Consider the following example. Can you tell what this nest of function calls is doing?
```{r}
round(cos(exp(sin(log10(sqrt(25))))), 2)
```

It's a mess. If instead the functions are called through a series of pipes, it's much easier to see what's happening:
```{r}
sqrt(25) %>%   # Take the square root of 25...
  log10() %>%
  sin() %>%
  exp() %>%
  cos() %>%
  round(2)
```

What the pipe is doing is putting the result from the left-hand side (or in our case from above) and put it into the right hand side (or in our case into the code below). When we write out code this way, it's much easier to see what is happening, as well as to fix any mistakes.
*******************************************************************************************************************************************



But let's get back to parsing our data. We can select only specific columns:
```{r}
mydata %>%
  select(animal, body_len)
```

or a range of columns:
```{r}
mydata %>%
  select(animal:body_len)
```

We can filter a tibble, retaining only the rows that satisfy a given condition:
```{r}
mydata %>%
  filter(kg>25)
```



*******************************************************************************************************************************************
## Exploring Your Data
Now we can start asking some questions!

The professor didn't actually bother to tell us anything about what's in the data set, so let's start by taking a look ourselves. Base R has some options for looking at a data set directly. For example, *View()* can be used to pop up the data as a table in a new tab.  
```{r}
View(pokemon)
```

We can see the STRucture of the data set in a compact format:
```{r}
str(pokemon)
```
The function *glimpse()* (provided by Tidyverse) is an improved version of this structural view:
```{r}
glimpse(pokemon)
```


Likewise, we can choose to print a few rows and columns to the screen:
```{r}
print(pokemon, n=10, width=6)
```


***************************************************************************************************************************************
## Viewing Data Subsets
We can choose to access pieces of the data frame by name or by index. The names of the data are the column headers:
```{r}
names(pokemon)
```

With this information, we can call out a column of the data set by name. for example, the second column is named "pokemon" and contains the name of each pokemon type as character strings. The *$* operator is used to specify a named element within a data object in R:
```{r}
pokemon$pokemon
```

That's a lot of Pokemon. We can choose to look at a subset of these values, for example the first 10 entries (remember that the first index in R is 1, not 0!):
```{r}
pokemon$pokemon[1:10]
```

Or the last 10:
```{r}
pokemon$pokemon[940:949]
```

We can also treat the data frame as a matrix, using the name as a column identifier:
```{r}
pokemon[["pokemon"]][1:10]
```

or alternately, with row-column syntax:
```{r}
pokemon[,"pokemon"][1:10]
```

Oops. That didn't work. Why? The error code contains a clue:
```{r}
pokemon[,"pokemon"]
```

Since the row-column syntax returns a column (949 x 1), the easiest thing to do here is to *transpose* (flip) the Pokemon names so they have dimension (1 x 949), then take the first 10 entries:
```{r}
t(pokemon[,"pokemon"])[1:10]
```

Alternately alternately, we can use the fact that Pokemon names are in the second column:
```{r}
pokemon[[2]][1:10]
t(pokemon[,2])[1:10]
```

We can also *pipe* these commands. Piping is a functionality provided by Tidyverse. The operator *%>%* "pipes" whatever is on the left-hand side of the "funnel" into the command(s) on the right-hand side. Putting a dot "." in front of the *$* operator here tells R to pass the value from the pipe into a specific location:
```{r}
pokemon %>% .$pokemon[1:10]
```

That didn't work. Why?
There are places where the integration between Tidyverse and base R isn't completely seamless; this is one of those places. We have to let Tidyverse keep calling the shots here to get the result we want. Instead of trying to index directly, we can use *slice()* from *dplyr* FIRST to index rows by their integer locations.
```{r}
pokemon %>% slice(1:10)
pokemon %>% slice(1:10) %>% .$pokemon
```


As you can see, these calls are interchangeable with the ones above in base R. 

You get the idea. There's a lot of ways to call pieces out of a data object, but we have to be a little careful when trying to mix and match across packages.


***************************************************************************************************************************************
## Summarizing Data
We can see that some of the components of the data are *categories* (type_1, type_2, generation_id), some are *measurements* (height, weight, attack, defense...), and some are *properties* (ID, pokemon (name), colors, url_image). 

We need to start analyzing these data, but we don't even know what questions to ask yet, so we can begin by exploring the data. Maybe we should see if the averages of some of these measurements are different for different categories of Pokemon?

The function *dplyr::summarize()* will let us do that easily.
```{r}
?dplyr::summarize
#?dplyr::summarise #These are the same function - either spelling is fine
```

Let's try it. Are there any differences in average measurements for Pokemon of different primary types? First we have to group the data according to primary type. What does this do to the data set?
```{r}
pokemon %>%
  group_by(type_1)
```

Then we can ask the *summarize()* function to calculate lots of different summary statistics for us.
```{r}
pokemon_avg_by_type<-pokemon %>%
  group_by(type_1) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_height=mean(height, na.rm=TRUE),
    mean_weight=mean(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
    mean_hp=mean(hp, na.rm=TRUE),
    mean_attack=mean(attack, na.rm=TRUE),
    mean_defense=mean(defense, na.rm=TRUE),
    mean_speed=mean(speed, na.rm=TRUE),
    n=n()
  )
glimpse(pokemon_avg_by_type)
```

**EXERCISE:** Create your own summary of the data set and save it as a new object. What do you want to group by? What summary measures do you want to take?
```{r}

```



***************************************************************************************************************************************
***************************************************************************************************************************************
# Plotting in Base R
Now we've processed the data a little bit, but it's still hard to see what these data mean - this is a big data set with a lot of groups and a lot of information. It will help to visualize the data.

There are lots of plots provided as part of base R. While the ggverse gives us a lot more flexibility and power, these functions are still a great place to start. 

*******************************************************************************************************************************************
## Two continuous variables: Scatterplot
The most basic plotting command is, of course:
```{r}
?plot
```

which will produce a generic x-y plot. By default, this is a scatter plot. Let's give it some x and y data:
```{r}
plot(pokemon$height, pokemon$weight) # first data are x axis, second are y axis
```

We can also change the type of plot using the "type" argument. 


**EXERCISE** In the code block below, make sure only one type is un-commented at a time to explore different options. What works well for showing these data? What doesn't work so well?
```{r}
plot(pokemon$height, 
     pokemon$weight,
     col="red",  # declare color
     type="l"  # lines
#     type="p" # points
#     type="b"  # both
#     type="o"  # lines & points over-plotted
     ) 
```

You can provide nicer labels for the axes and the plot title:
```{r}
plot(pokemon$height, 
     pokemon$weight,
     col="red",  # declare color
     type="p", # points
     main="Pokemon weight v height",
     xlab="Height",
     ylab="Weight"
)
```

*******************************************************************************************************************************************
## One continuous variable: Histograms
One continuous (numeric) variable can be plotted as a histogram:
```{r}
hist(pokemon$weight)
```
The range of the data is very large. Maybe it would be better to use smaller bins?
```{r}
hist(pokemon$weight, breaks=100)
```

Or space the breaks differently:
```{r}
hist(pokemon$weight, breaks=c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300,
                              350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000))
```
Honestly it might just be better to plot the log-transformed data:
```{r}
hist(log10(pokemon$weight))
```

*******************************************************************************************************************************************
## Two continuous variables: Barplot
Remember that we summarized our data earlier. Let's take a closer look at those summaries and see if we can observe any differences between groups. One easy way to do this is with a barplot:
```{r}
?barplot
```

Let's start with some of the basic statistics - height and weight. Are these different across groups?
```{r}
barplot(mean_height ~ type_1, pokemon_avg_by_type)
```


It's hard to see the x-axis labels on this plot. It would be easier if they were rotated. This is a little convoluted to do in base R; as we will see in the next workshop, this is much easier in ggplot.
```{r}
# First, create the plot
barplot(mean_height~type_1, # formula
        data=pokemon_avg_by_type,  # provide the name of the data object
        width=0.85,
        xlab="Type",
        ylab="Mean Height",
        xaxt = "n" # don't print the x-axis labels on the plot yet
        )  

# The summary object contains the category names, which are the x-axis labels we want
tick <- seq_along(pokemon_avg_by_type$type_1)

# Then we can use text() to put the labels on the axis
axis(1, at = tick, labels = FALSE)
text(tick-0.5, par("usr")[3]-0.3, # This positions the new labels
     pokemon_avg_by_type$type_1,  # what are the labels
     srt = 45,  # 45 degree text angle
     xpd = TRUE
     )
```

How about for weight?
```{r}
# First, create the plot
barplot(mean_weight~type_1, # formula
        data=pokemon_avg_by_type,  # provide the name of the data object
        width=0.85,
        xlab="Type",
        ylab="Mean Weight",
        xaxt = "n" # don't print the x-axis labels on the plot yet
        )  

# The summary object contains the category names, which are the x-axis labels we want
tick <- seq_along(pokemon_avg_by_type$type_1)

# Then we can use text() to put the labels on the axis
axis(1, at = tick, labels = FALSE)
text(tick-0.5, par("usr")[3]-0.3, # This positions the new labels
     pokemon_avg_by_type$type_1,  # what are the labels
     srt = 45,  # 45 degree text angle
     xpd = TRUE
     )
```
Uh-oh. What happened?

**EXERCISE:** Change the positions of the labels in the plot above to make it look better. Why do we need to change the position for this plot?

*******************************************************************************************************************************************
# Continuous (numeric) data by category: Boxplots
If your data have categorical variables (with distinct, discrete values or levels), those can be used as categories for plotting. We already know that pokemon have different types:
```{r}
unique(pokemon$type_1)
```

And that these types can be used as a grouping. If we want to see all the data points instead of just the summary statistics, we can ask R to do the data grouping inside a plot:
```{r}
boxplot(weight~type_1, # formula. Weight data are grouped by the levels in type_1
        data=pokemon,  # provide the name of the data object
        xlab="Type",
        ylab="Weight"
        )
```
Once again, we have to rotate the labels. This time, since the plot did the data grouping, it held onto the list of Pokemon types as a component of the plot object itself:
```{r}
# First, save the boxplot as an object
bp<-boxplot(weight~type_1, # formula. Weight data are grouped by the levels in type_1
        data=pokemon,  # provide the name of the data object
        xlab="Type",
        ylab="Weight",
        xaxt = "n" # don't print the x-axis labels on the plot yet
        )  

# The object contains the category names, which are the x-axis labels we want
tick <- seq_along(bp$names)

# Then we can use text() to put the labels on the axis
axis(1, at = tick, labels = FALSE)
text(tick, par("usr")[3] - 100, # This positions the new labels
     bp$names,  # what are the labels
     srt = 45,  # 45 degree text angle
     xpd = TRUE)
```

Let's make this plot for height as well. We can put two (or more) plots together in a single display using *par()*:
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))  #Call up a graphics window with one row and two columns

###########################################
# plot into the first row
# First, save the boxplot as an object
bp_weight<-boxplot(weight~type_1, # formula. Weight data are grouped by the levels in type_1
        data=pokemon,  # provide the name of the data object
        xlab="Type",
        ylab="Weight",
        xaxt = "n" # don't print the x-axis labels on the plot yet
        )  

# The object contains the category names, which are the x-axis labels we want
tick <- seq_along(bp_weight$names)

# Then we can use text() to put the labels on the axis
axis(1, at = tick, labels = FALSE)
text(tick, par("usr")[3] - 100, # This positions the new labels
     bp_weight$names,  # what are the labels
     srt = 45,  # 45 degree text angle
     xpd = TRUE)

###################################
# plot into the second row
bp_height<-boxplot(height~type_1, # formula. Weight data are grouped by the levels in type_1
        data=pokemon,  # provide the name of the data object
        xlab="Type",
        ylab="Height",
        xaxt = "n" # don't print the x-axis labels on the plot yet
        )  

# The object contains the category names, which are the x-axis labels we want
tick <- seq_along(bp_height$names)

# Then we can use text() to put the labels on the axis
axis(1, at = tick, labels = FALSE)
text(tick, par("usr")[3] - 1.5, # This positions the new labels
     bp_height$names,  # what are the labels
     srt = 45,  # 45 degree text angle
     xpd = TRUE)
```

**EXERCISE:** Make your own plots using the code in this section. Explore different measurements and groupings.
```{r}

```
