title: "R Notebook"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



# Getting started
Before we begin, we'll need to install and load the packages we'll be working with from CRAN:
```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, cowplot, ggpubr, pokemon)
```


# ggplot Syntax


## Working with cowplot: facets and wraps

## Data manipulations with dplyr

## Publication-quality plots with ggpubr


# The Wider ggverse: devtools
