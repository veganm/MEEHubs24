This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



# Getting started
This workshop assumes that you:
* Have R and Rstudio installed (this code was written in 4.3.1 "Beagle Scouts")
* Have a working directory set up for R
* Understand the basics of how R creates and handles objects
* Know the basic parts of a call to *ggplot()*, including how to change aesthetics and geometries


Before we begin, we'll need to install and load the packages we'll be working with from CRAN:
```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, pokemon, cowplot, ggpubr, gridExtra)
```

If you attended the prior workshops, you've already been introduced to Tidyverse and the pokemon data set. We'll also be working with some packages that add new functionality to the ggverse:
* *cowplot* is an add-on to *ggplot* with features that help with creating publication-quality figures, including new themes and functions for assembly of compound multi-panel figures. 
* *gridExtra* allows for more complex plot gridding
* *ggpubr* allows users to annotate plots, including overlay of statistical comparisons directly onto plots, and provides some user-friendly tools for manipulating ggplot formatting

## Working with cowplot: plot_grid



## Data manipulations with dplyr



## Publication-quality plots with ggpubr


# The Wider ggverse: devtools
