This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



# Getting started
This workshop assumes that you:
* Have R and Rstudio installed (this code was written in 4.3.1 "Beagle Scouts")
* Have a working directory set up for R
* Understand the basics of how R creates and handles objects
* Know the basic parts of a call to *ggplot()*, including how to change aesthetics and geometries


Before we begin, we'll need to install and load the packages we'll be working with from CRAN:
```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, pokemon, cowplot, ggpubr, gridExtra)
```

If you attended the prior workshops, you've already been introduced to Tidyverse and the pokemon data set. We'll also be working with some packages that add new functionality to the ggverse:
* *cowplot* is an add-on to *ggplot* with features that help with creating publication-quality figures, including new themes and functions for assembly of compound multi-panel figures. 
* *gridExtra* allows for more complex plot gridding
* *ggpubr* allows users to annotate plots, including overlay of statistical comparisons directly onto plots, and provides some user-friendly tools for manipulating ggplot formatting

## Working with cowplot: themes and plot_grid
This package includes some new theme options to explore:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=type_1)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal_vgrid()
#  theme_minimal_hgrid()
#  theme_minimal_grid(12)
#  theme_cowplot(12) # classic cowplot theme
```

Most of the functionality here is for creation of multipanel plots.
```{r}
# Save each ggplot as an object
p1<- ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=type_1)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()
p2<- ggplot(pokemon, aes(height, weight, color=type_1)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()

plot_grid(p1, p2,
#          labels="AUTO",  # labels panels as "A", "B" etc
          labels="auto",   # labels panels as "a", "b" etc
          label_size = 12)
```


The grid components can be basically any plot object. 
```{r}
p3<-ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=as.factor(generation_id))) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +  # Produces a smoothed line showing data trends
  theme_classic()+
  facet_wrap(~generation_id) +
  labs(color="Generation")

plot_grid(p1, p3)
```


It may be wise to re-orient and/or re-size sub-plots:
```{r}
plot_grid(p1, p3, 
          nrow=1, # orient plots in a single row
          rel_widths = c(1.5,2), # change relative heights,
#          ncol=1, # orient plots in a single column
#          rel_heights = c(1,2), # change relative heights,
          labels = "AUTO"
          )
```


**EXERCISE: You try it!** Create a new ggplot object and grid together two or more plots.
```{r}

```
