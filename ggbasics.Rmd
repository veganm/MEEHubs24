# Background
In this session we will:
* Learn the basic parts and syntax of a ggplot call
* Understand how ggplot expects input data to be organized
* Practice manipulating data structures to make plotting easier
* Explore some of the basic design options that ggplot makes available to you

Before we begin, make sure that you:
* Have R and Rstudio installed (this code was written in 4.3.1 "Beagle Scouts" and 4.3.2 "Eye Holes")
* Have a working directory set up for R
* Know what a package is and how to install packages from CRAN
* Understand the basics of how R creates and handles objects
* Know what a function is in R
* Know how to retrieve information from a data frame by name and index

**************************************************************************************************************************
# Getting Started
First, let's install and load in the packages we will need to use. We will be working with *ggplot()* (package *ggplot2*) for plot creation, which along with the data manipulation tools that we will need today, is part of the R Tidyverse. We also want some extra plot manipulation ability from a package called *cowplot* and some extra color options from *RColorBrewer*. And, in case you didn't attend the Absolute Basics workshop, you will also need to get the Pokemon data set. All of these are available on CRAN (the official R project repository) and can be installed directly using *install.packages()* and *library()* from base R.

However, there's a faster way to get all this done. The package *pacman* (PACkage MANagement tool) conveniently wraps library and package related functions and names them in an intuitive and consistent fashion to speed up workflow. Let's see it in action. First, we'll install *pacman* the old-fashoned way:
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
install.packages("pacman")
```

Now that pacman is installed, we can use its *p_load()* function to speed up library handling. This function takes a list of CRAN packages, checks to see whether you already have them installed, installs anything that's missing, then loads everything in the list into your workspace. All with one call!
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, RColorBrewer, pokemon, colorspace, dichromat, remotes, cowplot, Hmisc)
```

(By way of explanation here: The syntax *package::function()* tells R to execute the named function as coded in the specified package. This is useful when there are functions with the same name in different packages, to make sure you are calling the right one when you need it, and when you only need the one function and don't want to load an entire package.)


**************************************************************************************************************************
# Viewing The Data
Let's see what we're dealing with. Base R had a few options for looking at a data set directly, and those still work. For example, *View()* can be used to pop up the data as a table in a new tab.  
```{r}
View(pokemon)
```

Likewise, we can choose to print a few rows and columns to the screen:
```{r}
print(pokemon)
```

However, Tidyverse has given us some new tools that are worth trying out. The *glimpse()* function provided via package *dplyr* will show a transposed version of the data (columns run down the page, data runs across) along with the dimensions of the data and will try to show you as much of the data as possible:
```{r}
glimpse(pokemon)
```
This view is nice because it lets you see all the data types along with a snapshot of the first few rows, to get an idea of what the data set contains.

The names of the data are the column headers:
```{r}
names(pokemon)
```



**************************************************************************************************************************
# Plotting With ggplot
*ggplot2* is the most-used package for producing data visualizations in R. It's tremendously powerful and flexible, with many, many ways to customize a plot.

The basics of a *ggplot2* call are simple. You need to provide, at minimum:
* **Data** (the name of the data frame that contains the data for plotting)
* **Aesthetics** (aes; what is being mapped onto the x and y axes, as well as what information you want to use to determine the attributes such as color, shape, size, etc. of plot elements)
* **Geometry** (what kind of plot - scatter, line, bar, histogram...) 


## Syntax
Let's begin by asking whether there is a relationship between attack and defense scores overall. What happens if we try to create a ggplot from these data but without specifying the geometry?
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense))  # data + aesthetics (x,y) 
```


We need to specify the kind of plot we want to produce. These are both *quantitative* variables, so a scatterplot (where the x and y axis are both continuous numeric scales) is appropriate. 
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense)) +  # data + aesthetics (x,y) 
  geom_point() # creates a scatter plot
```

Inside the geometry, we can do things like change the color, shape, and size of all of the points. To see options for point shapes, check out
```{r}
?par
?points
```

and for colors:
```{r}
?colors # you want colors {grDevices}
colors(distinct = TRUE)
```

OK, now the plot. Try changing these options! 
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense)) +  # data + aesthetics (x,y) 
  geom_point(shape="square", size=0.5, color="red") # creates a scatter plot
```

***************************************************************************************************************************************
## Informative Aesthetics By Group
We can add informative aesthetics by using one or more of the *categorical variables* to divide the data into groups. For example, Pokemon are of different, unique types, and each row in the data set contains information on the primary type of the Pokemon that was measured:
```{r}
unique(pokemon$type_1)
```

Maybe the relationship between attach and defense is different across types?

We can use this information to color each point according to the type of the Pokemon:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=type_1)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point()
```

Since there are so many points, we can try making them a little bit transparent to see if that helps:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=type_1)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) #alpha is a number between 0 and 1 that specifies opacity - try changing this!
```

We can add more than one informational aesthetic at a time. For example, you think you remember seeing a paper on Pokemon strength changing over generations; maybe that's a factor to investigate in these data?
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon,  # the data
       aes(attack, defense,  # x and y
           color=type_1, # color points by type
           shape=generation_id  # point shape indicates generation
           )) +   
  geom_point()
```

That didn't work! We tried to use a numeric variable (generation_id is a *double*, a non-integer numeric value) as a category! Also, as it turns out, not all of the entries have a generation assigned; we'll deal with that later.
```{r}
unique(pokemon$generation_id)
```

Fortunately, it's easy to convert a numeric variable to a categorical one - as long as the number of unique values is usably small.
```{r}
unique(as.factor(pokemon$generation_id))
```

If we tell *ggplot()* to use generation ID *as a factor* (as if each unique value is the label for a category), now our plot will work.
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon,  # the data
       aes(attack, defense,  # x and y
           color=type_1, # color points by type
           shape=as.factor(generation_id)  # point shape indicates generation
           )) +   
  geom_point(alpha=0.8) # remember that alpha in [0,1] controls point opacity
```

The plot now is so busy that R is warning us about our design! We'll have to simplify this plot so it's usable. But first, a few more design elements.

****************************************************************************************************************************************
## Themes
We don't have to stick with the basic design. In *ggplot*, you can specify *themes* that provide different defaults for plot structural elements like the plot background and axes. Let's try a few!
```{r}
# Un-comment one theme at a time by removing the hash tag at the start of the line.
# Remember that you can only have one theme at a time, 
# so be sure to put a hash tag in front of any themes you aren't using!
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=type_1)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  theme_void()
#  theme_minimal()
#  theme_nothing()
#  theme_grey()
#  theme_dark()
#  theme_light()
#  theme_classic()
#  theme_bw()
```

For information on a given theme, consult its help file:
```{r}
?theme_classic
```


**EXERCISE: Now you try!** Use the empty code block below to make a new scatter plot of your own. Use a different set of x and y components - what other pair(s) of numeric data might be interesting? Try changing the shape, size, color, and/or transparency of the points, and try a few different themes. What options make the plot more or less legible?
```{r}

```


****************************************************************************************************************************************
## Theme Elements and Plot Labels
We can control the size/position/color/etc of text, and change how different plot elements are labeled, with *theme()*. 
```{r}
?theme
```


Try changing some of these options!
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=type_1)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() + # the classics never get old
    theme(axis.text=element_text(size=14), 
        axis.title=element_text(size=14, face="bold", color="blue"), 
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, size=14),  # hjust to center the text
        legend.text=element_text(size=8),
        legend.title=element_text(size=12)) +
  labs(title="Attack vs defense", y="Defense", x="Attack", color="Type 1")
```

You can also remove text elements by making them blank:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=type_1)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() + # the classics never get old
    theme(axis.text=element_text(size=14), 
        axis.title=element_text(size=14, face="bold"), 
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, size=14),  # hjust to center the text
        legend.text=element_text(size=8),
        legend.title=element_blank()   # removes the legend title
        ) +
  labs(title="Attack vs defense", y="Defense", x="Attack")
```

And remove elements entirely by setting *element.position = "none"*:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=type_1)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() + # the classics never get old
    theme(axis.text=element_text(size=14), 
        axis.title=element_text(size=14, face="bold"), 
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, size=14),  # hjust to center the text
        legend.text=element_text(size=14),
        legend.position="none"             # no more legend!
        ) +
  labs(title="Attack vs defense", y="Defense", x="Attack")
```

**EXERCISE: Now you try!** Use the empty code block below to modify the themes and labels of your own plot. Play around with centering of different elements (using hjust and vjust), fonts, colors... 
```{r}

```



****************************************************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************************************************
# Facets: facet_wrap() and facet_grid()
Our attempts at visualizing the attack/defense relationship vs. type and generation so far have produced really busy plots. Maybe it would be better to separate out different parts of the data onto separate plots. Fortunately, we don't have to go through the trouble of creating these plot by plot.

The function *facet_wrap()* lets us specify a single factor to use for separating the data. For example, if we want to plot Pokemon of different generations on different plots, we can do so:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y) 
  geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(generation_id))) +
  theme_classic()+
  facet_wrap(~generation_id)
```
Note that *facet_wrap()* automatically converted the numeric variable *generation_id* into a factor. 

Let's say we want to add lines to the scatter plot, to show the relationship between the attack and defense variables. The geometry *geom_line()* will add a line plot, using lines to connect adjacent points:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=as.factor(generation_id))) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +  # Produces a line connecting data points
  theme_classic() # the classics never get old
```

Technically that worked, but the plot is even more busy than before, and this doesn't do a very good job of showing the relationship between our x and y variables. There's a better choice for that job.
```{r}
?geom_smooth()
```

Let's see it in action:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=as.factor(generation_id))) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +  # Produces a smoothed line showing data trends
  theme_classic() # the classics never get old
```

We didn't tell the smoothed lines what color to be, but they are the same colors as in the data. This is due to the way that **ggplot** handles **aesthetic inheritances**. In this case, because the color aesthetic is in the "boss" call to *ggplot()*, all of the geometries will inherit that color aesthetic along with the data aesthetics - unless we say otherwise.

If we instead put the color aesthetic in the first geometry, this happens:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(generation_id))) +
  geom_smooth() +  # Produces a smoothed line showing data trends
  theme_classic() 
```

Now there is a single smoothed fit line. *geom_smooth()* only has the x/y aesthetics from the "boss" call, and that's all it knows to do. The color aesthetic from *geom_point()* isn't passed on to any other geometries in the same plot.

What if we put the color aesthetic into the *geom_smooth* function?
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(color=as.factor(generation_id))) +  # Produces a smoothed line showing data trends
  theme_classic() 
```

Same thing. When we specify the color aesthetic in the "boss" call to *ggplot*, all of the geometries can use it (unless we tell them not to). If we specify an aesthetic in only one element, only that element gets to use it.

*ggplot* will let you **overwrite** aesthetics, which comes in handy if you do have more than one layer of elements in a plot. For example, if we want to force all of the smoothed lines to be the same color, we can easily do so by giving the *geom_smooth* a local value for color. This will replace the global color scheme based on generation, only within the smoothed-lines layer.
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=as.factor(generation_id))) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(group=1)) +  # Produces a smoothed line showing data trends
  theme_classic() # the classics never get old
```


Now that we know about inheritances and stacking geometries, let's get back to trying to simplify our plot. What if we facet this out?
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=as.factor(generation_id))) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +  # Produces a smoothed line showing data trends
  theme_classic()+
  facet_wrap(~generation_id)
```

As you can see, the smoothed line is applied to the data *within each grid panel* and is the same color as the points, since both geometries have inherited all their aesthetics from the "boss" call. 

We still want to see the data trends by type and by generation. We can use aesthetic inheritances to do this. Let's try faceting the data by type, then color by generation:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(generation_id))) +
  geom_smooth() +  # Produces a smoothed line showing data trends
  theme_classic()+
  facet_wrap(~type_1)
```

Notice that the smoothing function is upset with us here - there aren't enough points in some of these panels for smoothing to work properly.

The function *facet_grid()* lets us separate the data by two factors simultaneously, making a grid. This function requires us to specify the data defining facet groups as *vars()*. Notice that we can specify which factor goes along rows vs. columns of the grid; if we don't specify, the first variable we provide will go down the rows and the second along the columns.
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(generation_id))) +
  theme_light()+
  facet_grid(vars(type_1), vars(generation_id))
#  facet_grid(cols=vars(type_1), rows=vars(generation_id))
```

This is a very big plot! Click on "Show in new window" to get a closer look.

****************************************************************************************************************************************
# Too Much Data!
This data set is really big, and some of these groups are clearly quite small. Maybe we want to limit our analysis to groups that have a decent range (to avoid skewing the relationship between variables) and enough data points to be meaningful. A piori, let's say we want to keep groups that represent at least 70 pokemon, and for which there are attack values over most of the available range (50-150).
```{r}
pokemon_summary<-pokemon %>%
  group_by(type_1) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(n=n(),
                   min_attack=min(attack),
                   max_attack=max(attack))
pokemon_summary
```

Let's find the pokemon for which this is true:
```{r}
pokemon_summary %>%
  filter(n>=70 & min_attack <50 & max_attack >150)
```

We can filter our data set to include only pokemon of these four types for analysis. First we can get the types:
```{r}
vars<- pokemon_summary %>%
  filter(n>=70 & min_attack <50 & max_attack >150) %>%
  select(type_1)
```

Then we can filter:
```{r}
pokemon_f<-pokemon %>%
  filter(
  )
```


****************************************************************************************************************************************
# Briefly, Some More Geometries

## One Quantitative Variable: Histograms, Densities, and Violins
Histograms are handy for showing distributions of a quantitative variable. Let's see how hit points (hp) are distributed overall:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(hp)) +
  geom_histogram(color="white", # outline color
                 fill="darkgreen" # fill color
                 )+
  theme_classic()
```

As always, aesthetics can be informational. For example, we can see the distributions of hit points for Pokemon of different types:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(hp, fill=type_1)) +
  geom_histogram(color="white", # outline color
                 binwidth=10)+
  theme_classic()+
  facet_wrap(~type_1)
```

Densities also show distributions nicely. Since these data are converted to relative frequency within groups, it can be easier to compare densities than raw counts when the total number of data points is very different across groups.
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(hp, fill=type_1)) +
  geom_density(color="grey")+
  theme_classic()+
  facet_wrap(~type_1)
```
This is a nice way to see the features in the data. But if we want to make comparisons across groups, we want to have the data that are being compared on a single plot. How can we do that?

If you want to show distributions on top of each other, it can sometimes be effective to use densities if the number of groups isn't too large:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(hp, fill=type_1)) +
  geom_density(color="grey", alpha=0.5)+ # and add some transparency
  theme_classic()
```

This is honestly too many levels to show on top of each other in the same plot. A stacked histogram is another option, but this isn't easy to read either:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(hp, fill=type_1)) +
  geom_histogram(color="white", # outline color
                 binwidth=10)+
  theme_classic()
```

If we want to compare across groups, maybe we should show distributions of the quantitative variable side by side instead. A boxplot is one option:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(y=hp, x=type_1, fill=type_1)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust = 0.6))
```


A violin plot can also be attractive and informative, particularly for data like these that are not normally distributed:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(y=hp, x=type_1, fill=type_1)) +
  geom_violin()+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust = 0.6))
```


If the number of points in each category isn't too large, it is often recommended to over-plot the raw data:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(y=hp, x=type_1, fill=type_1)) +
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, size=0.5)+
  geom_violin()+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust = 0.6))
```
That didn't work. Geometries are deposited on the plot in order of appearance - if we want to see the data points AND have a color fill for the violins, we have to reverse the order:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(y=hp, x=type_1, fill=type_1)) +
  geom_violin()+
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, size=0.5)+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust = 0.6))
```

Or we can remove the violin fill. Now we need to switch to *color* instead of *fill* so that the data points have the right colors:
```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(y=hp, x=type_1, color=type_1)) +
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, size=0.5)+
  geom_violin(fill=NA)+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust = 0.6))
```


## Bar Plots
Bar plots can be used to summarize quantitative data over categories. We could do this manually by calculating the means and standard deviations of the data, saving those values in a new tibble, and plotting those data, or the *stat_summary()* function from **Hmisc** can make the plot for us:
```{r}
ggplot(data = pokemon, mapping = aes(x = type_1, y=hp, fill=type_1)) +
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "col") + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl, geom = "errorbar", width = .5, fun.args = list(mult = 1))+
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust=0.8))
```

Bar plots can also be used to show relationships between categories. For example, we might ask how egg types are distributed over different types of Pokemon:
```{r}
ggplot(data = pokemon, mapping = aes(x = type_1, fill = egg_group_1)) +
    geom_bar() +  # Automatically counts the number of cases at each x position
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust=0.8))
```
The raw counts are hard to read. We could put the counts next to each other:
```{r}
pEggDodge<-ggplot(data = pokemon, mapping = aes(x = type_1, fill = egg_group_1)) +
    geom_bar(position="dodge") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust=0.8))
pEggDodge
```

but this plot is sprawling. Let's make a stacked plot of proportions instead:
```{r}
pEggStack<-ggplot(data = pokemon, mapping = aes(x = type_1, fill = egg_group_1)) +
    geom_bar(position="fill") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust=0.8))
pEggStack
```


**EXERCISE:** Change the plot options in this section to figure out what they do. (It can be helpful to copy a line or block of code, comment out the original, then start making changes to the copy - this lets you keep the old code for reference while you are breaking the options.)
```{r}

```

**EXERCISE: Now you try!** Pick two or three columns from the Pokemon data set and use the empty code block below to create your own plot of those data. What difference does it make when you move a color/shape aesthetic from the main call into the geometry call? What difference does it make when you have more than one geometry? 
```{r}

```



****************************************************************************************************************************************
**************************************************************************************************************************
# Fine-Tuning the Aesthetics: Color Scales and Palettes
Next, let's see if there is any relationship between attack/defense components and speed. 

(Notice that we are saving the plot as an object now; see if you can find it in your environment. What is contained in a *ggplot* object? )
```{r}
pAttackVsSpeed <- ggplot(pokemon, aes(attack, defense, color=speed)) +  # data + aesthetics (x, y, point color) 
  geom_point()
pAttackVsSpeed
```


Maybe, but it's hard to see like this. We don't have to use the default colors - in fact, we probably shouldn't.

Since we are trying to color the points according to a numeric (continuous) variable, we need a *continuous color scale*. We can do this with a custom *color gradient*. 
We'll start with the plot we just saved; once we have saved a plot, we can add new options to it exactly as if it were one continuous *ggplot()* call.
```{r}
pAttackVsSpeed + scale_color_gradient(low="blue", high="darkorange")
```
We can also set up a three-color gradient:
```{r}
pAttackVsSpeed +
  scale_color_gradient2(low="blue", mid="violet", high="darkred")
```


By default, the  midpoint of the color scale is 0, but clearly that doesn't work here. Instead, we can set the midpoint (try a few different values!):
```{r}
pAttackVsSpeed +  
  scale_color_gradient2(low="blue", mid="violet", high="darkred", midpoint=85)
```

Or we can specify a pre-made continuous color scale (here, the Viridis continuous scale, which is perceptually uniform in both colour and black-and-white display, is an easy option to ensure good perceptive properties of your visulizations):
```{r}
pAttackVsSpeed + scale_color_viridis_c()
```
We can take a given gradient and run it backwards:
```{r}
pAttackVsSpeed + scale_color_viridis_c(direction=-1)
```
Viridis_c presents eight scales as options:
```{r}

## Custom Color Scales with ColorBrewer
ColorBrewer provides discrete color schemes. The *brewer* palettes can be found on the help page:
```{r}
?scale_color_brewer
```

The *distiller* scales interpolate these palettes to a continuous scale (note that this is not guaranteed to look good!)
```{r}
pAttackVsSpeed + scale_color_distiller()
pAttackVsSpeed + scale_color_distiller(palette="BrBG")
pAttackVsSpeed + scale_color_distiller(palette="Set3")
pAttackVsSpeed + scale_color_distiller(palette="PuBuGn")
```


Since these scales are designed to be discrete, let's generate a plot that uses discrete (categorical) data. Earlier, we made a plot to show how egg types are distributed over different types of Pokemon:
```{r}
pEggStack
```

Discrete categories do work better with discrete scales, but the default colors are fairly unpleasant. Let's use ColorBrewer to access some new options.
```{r}
pEggStack + scale_color_brewer()
```

Why didn't that work?
```{r}
pEggStack + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

Now we got our colors, but the data have too many levels! What do?

Well, for one, we can define our own color palette. There are 15 egg groups, so we need 15 colors. We can pick them manually (by name or by hex code) or generate them from a pre-existing palette:
```{r}
?palettes
```

```{r}
colvec<-c("red", "orangered2", "orange3", "orange2", "yellow2", 
          "olivedrab1", "lightgreen", "green", "green4", "mediumturquoise",
          "paleturquoise2", "dodgerblue", "dodgerblue4", "mediumpurple", "mediumvioletred")
colvec_rainbow<-rainbow(length(unique(pokemon$egg_group_1)), s=1, v=1)          # When you need a number of items to match data dimensions,
colvec_hcl<-hcl.colors(length(unique(pokemon$egg_group_1)), palette="viridis")  # it's best to ask the data directly!
colvec_heat<-heat.colors(length(unique(pokemon$egg_group_1)))                 
```

Now we can use any of these to fill. This is a big plot; open it in a new window. 
```{r}
p1<-pEggStack + scale_fill_manual(values=colvec, guide=guide_legend(ncol=2))
p2<-pEggStack + scale_fill_manual(values=colvec_rainbow, guide=guide_legend(ncol=2))
p3<-pEggStack + scale_fill_manual(values=colvec_hcl, guide=guide_legend(ncol=2))
p4<-pEggStack + scale_fill_manual(values=colvec_heat, guide=guide_legend(ncol=2))
p5<-plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
p5
```

**EXERCISE:** Build a palette and use it to color one of the plots that we have saved as objects so far.
```{r}

```

# Testing Color Palettes
As part of selecting or creating color palettes, it is important to make sure that your chosen color scheme will still work well when desaturated (black and white) and for viewers with different forms of color-blindness. Fortunately, there are ways of assessing this for color schemes and for specific figures in R.

## Palettes and manipulations with colorspace
The **colorspace** package is designed as a broad toolbox for selecting, creating, and manipulating color palettes. The package ships with a wide range of pre-defined palettes for you to use (including many of the ColorBrewer scales), which can be glimpsed with the *hcl_palettes()* function:
```{r}
hcl_palettes(plot = TRUE)
```

A suitable vector of colors can be easily computed by specifying the desired number of colors and the palette name:
```{r}
q8 <- qualitative_hcl(8, palette = "Dark 3")
q8
```
There are onboard functions for demoing palettes and exploring their parameters:
```{r}
demoplot(q8, "bar")
hclplot(q8)
specplot(q8, type = "o")
```

The functions for sequential and diverging palettes are analogous. Here we can see how differently these palettes are shaped in, well, colorspace:
```{r}
s8 <- sequential_hcl(8, palette = "Greens 3")
hclplot(s8)
d8 <- diverging_hcl(8, palette = "Blue-Red")
hclplot(d8)
```

Hue/chroma/luminance parameters can be modified, thus allowing for easy customization of each palette. 
```{r}
specplot(lighten(q8, amount=0.5, space="combined"))
specplot(darken(q8, amount=0.5, space="combined"))
```


Importantly, the **colorspace** package includes the function *desaturate()*, which can be used to partially or completely desaturate a color scheme.
```{r}
hclplot(desaturate(q8, amount=0.5))
specplot(desaturate(q8, amount=0.5))
```

Completely desaturate a color scheme to see how it will look in black and white:
```{r}
specplot(desaturate(q8, amount=1))
```
We can use these functions for color schemes not provided by the package:
```{r}
specplot(scales::viridis_pal()(8))
specplot(desaturate((scales::viridis_pal()(8)), amount=1))
```

**EXERCISE:** Use these tools to interrogate one of the palettes we have just seen. Make your own palette and do the same.
```{r}

```



## Simulating color blindness with colorblindr
This package currently depends on the development versions of **cowplot** and **colorspace**, so let's install those first:
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
remotes::install_github("wilkelab/cowplot")
install.packages("colorspace", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
```

Then we can install **colorblindr** from repository:
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
remotes::install_github("clauswilke/colorblindr")
```

Once the package is installed, load it in:
```{r}
library(colorblindr)
```

This package lets us look at figures in various color-deficiency situations. Let's use the plot we saved earlier:
```{r}
pAttackVsSpeed
```

How does the default palette (blues) look to color-blind eyes?
```{r}
cvd_grid(pAttackVsSpeed)
```

With our custom gradient?
```{r}
cvd_grid(pAttackVsSpeed + scale_color_gradient2(low="blue", mid="violet", high="darkred", midpoint=85))
```

What about if we use the Viridis default scale?
```{r}
cvd_grid(pAttackVsSpeed+scale_color_viridis_c())
```


**EXERCISE: You try it!** Use the color tools explained here to assess the performance of different color scales of your choice. Try to find scales that work badly.
```{r}

```
